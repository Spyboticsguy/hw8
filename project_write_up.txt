We worked on this homework assignment alone, using only this semester's course materials.

The Movie
	We created a film that spoofed on the popular use of robots as 'spy devices,'
	controlled via laptop. The film uses special effects to simulate a spy robot
	'booting up,' scanning the area once it locates a target object, then flashing red
	in order to indicate an alarm or some other type of problem. The non-robot-filmed
	footage was used to futher clarify this premise and give context to the sequence
	filmed by the robot itself.

Deviations from Specifications
	We combined the filming and acting code into a single file - filmingActingCode.py.
	This was done in pursuit of the narrative of the film - it makes sense that the robot, as a
	surveillance device, would capture or stream a first-person view of its surroundings. It was
	also necessary to move and film to create some of the special effects used in the film, making it
	a more desirable approach to combine the two code files overall.
	
Other Notes
	If you have not done so, please check README.txt for additional info on the locations of individual files,
	as well as important information on running the project.
	For the most part, this should be self-explanatory, but if you have any questions, the README should answer them.
